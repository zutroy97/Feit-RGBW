Replace the controller included with the Feit 48ft. LED Outdoor Weatherproof Color Changing String Light Set (Feit Model # 72031) available from Costco ( https://www.costco.com/Feit-48ft.-LED-Outdoor-Weatherproof-Color-Changing-String-Light-Set%2C-Black.product.100306514.html ) with a NodeMCU board.

The included controller only has a few settings and colors, & no fading.

This project attempts to add the items above, MQTT support, while allowing the continued use of the included remote.
